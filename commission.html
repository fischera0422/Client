            <h2>Commission Process</h2>
            <p>Art, like the pieces to the right, is created through the process of imagination and creativity, but it isn't just up to the artist. We use our creative outlet to help those with creative minds bring life to the ideas in their head. The commission process is pretty simple! Once the
            commission form is filled out, we are notified of the new submission and try to send an email back within 24-48 hours regarding the timeline we are currently working with. We try to send emails with updates throughout the process as well to keep you updated while your creation is being crafted! We strive to live by our motto, “you dream it, we'll make it”.</p>
